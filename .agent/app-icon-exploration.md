- Communicate digital protection/fence concept
- Feel family-friendly and trustworthy
- Work well at various sizes (App Store, Home Screen, Settings)

## 📱 Icon Concepts Generated

### **Concept 1: Shield with Family**
**Theme:** Protection & Family Unity

**Description:**
- Central shield shape representing protection
- Parent figure with two children silhouettes inside
- Fence/lattice pattern at the bottom of shield
- Blue-purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- iOS-style rounded square

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clearly communicates "parental protection"
- ✅ Family-friendly imagery
- ✅ Shield conveys security and safety
- ✅ Matches app's primary colors

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ May be too literal/detailed for small sizes

**Theme:** Connection & Protection

**Description:**
- Abstract overlapping circles
- Larger circle (parent) overlapping smaller circles (children)
- Minimalist, modern aesthetic
- Blue-purple gradient background
- Subtle, professional look

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Very minimalist and clean

- ✅ Less literal, more sophisticated

**Weaknesses:**

**Theme:** Smart Home Protection

**Description:**
- House/home shape created from geometric circuit-like lines
